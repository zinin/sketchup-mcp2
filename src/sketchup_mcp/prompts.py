_STRATEGY_TEXT = """\
You are working with a SketchUp model through the sketchup-mcp server.
Follow this strategy to be effective and avoid common pitfalls.

# 1. Pre-flight — ALWAYS start with
- get_model_info() — units, model bbox, layer list, total entity count.
- If the user references existing geometry: list_components or
  find_components(name=...) to locate IDs.
- For visual context after major changes:
  get_viewport_screenshot(view_preset="iso", zoom_extents=true).

# 2. Tool priority
1. Typed tools first — create_component, transform_component,
   set_material, boolean_operation, chamfer_edge, fillet_edge,
   create_mortise_tenon, create_dovetail, create_finger_joint,
   create_layer, delete_component. They handle units, transactions,
   and edge cases.
2. eval_ruby ONLY when typed tools cannot express the operation
   (custom curves, Follow Me, complex transformations,
   ComponentDefinition manipulation, layer attributes).
3. Never use eval_ruby for things a typed tool already does — you
   lose validation, mm-conversion, and atomic undo.

# 3. Conventions
- ALL linear dimensions are millimeters at the MCP boundary.
  SketchUp's Ruby API uses inches internally; the server converts.
- ALL angles are degrees.
- Entity IDs are integers but accept strings (server casts via .to_i).
- New geometry lives inside SketchUp Groups so it can be moved/deleted
  as a unit.

# 4. After every mutation — verify
- Geometry, material, boolean, joinery, and edge tools that create or
  modify a single entity return {id, name, type, bbox_mm}. When bbox_mm
  is returned, read it to confirm the result matches the intent before
  the next step (and to relocate the entity if its id becomes stale
  after destructive operations like boolean_operation).
- Other tools — delete_component, create_layer, undo, list/find
  queries, get_model_info, get_selection — have their own response
  shapes; see the tool docs.
- For visual confirmation across multiple parts:
  get_viewport_screenshot(view_preset="iso", zoom_extents=true).

# 5. Error recovery
- If a mutation produced wrong geometry — call undo immediately, then
  retry with corrected parameters. Do not pile up bad geometry hoping
  to fix it later.
- boolean_operation, chamfer_edge, fillet_edge are unreliable on
  non-manifold meshes. If they fail, try with simpler input or use
  eval_ruby for a manual workaround.

# 6. Known traps
- Group#subtract is REVERSED: A.subtract(B) returns B - A. Inside
  eval_ruby, to get "target minus tool", call tool.subtract(target).
- Sketchup::Model#undo does not exist. The undo MCP tool uses
  Sketchup.send_action("editUndo:") internally — just call it.
- Layers in SketchUp are visibility flags, not folders. Adding an
  entity to a layer doesn't move it in the hierarchy.

# 7. Joinery defaults
For mortise/tenon/dovetail/finger joints, when the user doesn't
specify:
- joint dimensions ≈ 0.3-0.5 × board thickness;
- number of fingers/tails: 3-5 for typical drawer-width boards
  (200-400 mm);
- if uncertain, ASK before generating — joints are hard to fix after
  the fact without scrapping the boards.

# 8. eval_ruby gate (warehouse build)
In the Extension Warehouse build of the SketchUp extension, eval_ruby
is disabled by default. If a call to eval_ruby returns a string
starting with "eval_ruby is disabled.", that is not a failure: it is
the extension's actionable instruction for the user. Surface the full
message to the user verbatim — do not paraphrase, do not retry the same
code, do not silently fall back to typed tools without telling the user
that eval was unavailable. The user can enable Ruby evaluation in
Plugins → MCP Server → Settings...
