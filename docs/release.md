# Releasing a New Version

Step-by-step for the next PyPI/GitHub release. PyPI tokens live in `~/.pypirc` (chmod 600); `twine` reads them automatically.

## Breaking changes (v0.1.0)

- **Wire protocol: one-time handshake on connect.** Every TCP connection
  must now begin with a JSON-RPC `hello` request carrying
  `params.client_version`; the server replies with `server_version` and
  `client_id`. Per-request `client_version` / per-response
  `server_version` envelopes are **removed**. Old Python clients (any
  release prior to this one) lack the `hello` handshake entirely and
  the server rejects their first frame with JSON-RPC `-32600`
  (`"first method must be 'hello'"`); the client and the `.rbz` must
  be upgraded together.
- **Multi-client support.** The Ruby plugin now accepts N concurrent TCP
  clients; the previous "single-client-at-a-time" behavior is gone — a
  second concurrent connection no longer blocks until Python's
  `SKETCHUP_MCP_TIMEOUT` fires. The previous workaround (restart the
  plugin or temporarily disable the `sketchup` MCP server in Claude
  Code to run `smoke_check.py` alongside an attached MCP session) is no
  longer necessary.

## 0. Pre-flight

```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD   # local-only commits ahead of remote
git status                              # tree should have no tracked-file modifications
```

If HEAD has diverged from `origin/master`, decide **rebase** vs **merge** before the bump commit.

```bash
# Confirm Trimble product_id matches the new identity (v0.2.0+).
grep '"product_id"' mcp_for_sketchup/extension.json
# Expected: "product_id": "MCP_FOR_SKETCHUP"
```

## 1. Bump version in 7 places (must match)

- `pyproject.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"`
- `src/sketchup_mcp/__init__.py` — `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`
- `src/sketchup_mcp/compat.py` — `MAX_RUBY = "X.Y.Z"` (and `MIN_RUBY` only if this release breaks wire/handler contract with the previous Ruby plugin)
- `mcp_for_sketchup/extension.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `mcp_for_sketchup/package.rb` — `VERSION = 'X.Y.Z'`
- `mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup.rb` — `ext.version = 'X.Y.Z'`
- `mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup/core/compat.rb` — `SERVER_VERSION = "X.Y.Z"` and `MAX_PYTHON = "X.Y.Z"` (and `MIN_PYTHON` only if this release breaks wire/handler contract with the previous Python client)

**MIN/MAX policy:** default to bumping only `MAX_*` to the new release; keep `MIN_*` pointing to the oldest counterpart still supported. Three invariant tests defend against typos and forgotten bumps:

* `test_min_le_max_invariant` (Python + Ruby) — range cannot be empty.
* `test_max_ruby_matches_python_version` (Python) — Python's view of Ruby max must equal current `CLIENT_VERSION` at release time.
* `test_max_python_matches_server_version` (Ruby) — Ruby's view of Python max must equal plugin `SERVER_VERSION` at release time.

Run `uv lock` to refresh `uv.lock` with the new project version (otherwise the next `uv` call updates it post-release and you end up with a stray `chore: sync uv.lock` commit). Commit (`chore: bump to vX.Y.Z`) and push.

## 2. Pre-flight tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q          # Python — must be green
ruby test/run_all.rb             # Ruby — must be green
```

## 3. Build artifacts

```bash
rm -rf dist/ mcp_for_sketchup/*.rbz
uv build                                              # → dist/*.whl + dist/*.tar.gz
uvx twine check dist/*                                # validate metadata / README rendering
(cd mcp_for_sketchup && ruby package.rb --variant=warehouse)  # → mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-warehouse.rbz
(cd mcp_for_sketchup && ruby package.rb --variant=github)     # → mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-github.rbz
```

`package.rb` needs the `rubyzip` gem: `gem install --user-install rubyzip`.

## 4. TestPyPI rehearsal

```bash
uvx twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Verify install in a fresh venv (the project's own `.venv` would conflict):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/verify && cd /tmp/verify && uv venv -q && \
  uv pip install -q --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
    --index-strategy unsafe-best-match \
    sketchup-mcp2==X.Y.Z && \
  .venv/bin/python -c "import sketchup_mcp; print(sketchup_mcp.__version__)"
rm -rf /tmp/verify
```

`--extra-index-url` is required — TestPyPI doesn't host the `mcp` dependency.
`--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` is required because uv otherwise locks onto the first index that contains the package at all; once `sketchup-mcp2` exists on pypi.org, uv won't look at TestPyPI for the new version without this flag.

## 5. Production PyPI

```bash
uvx twine upload dist/*
```

**Warning:** PyPI versions are **immutable**. Once `X.Y.Z` is uploaded, it can never be re-uploaded — even after deletion. If something is broken post-upload, bump to `X.Y.(Z+1)`.

## 6. Git tag + GitHub Release

Attach both `.rbz` variants (see [§3](#3-build-artifacts)) plus the Python wheel/sdist. The github variant attached here must already be self-signed via the Trimble signing service; the warehouse variant is the same unsigned build you submit to EW (EW signs its own copy after review):

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z" \
  --notes "..." \
  dist/sketchup_mcp2-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl \
  dist/sketchup_mcp2-X.Y.Z.tar.gz \
  mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-github.rbz \
  mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-warehouse.rbz
```

## 7. Extension Warehouse submission (optional, ~2–3 day review)

Submitting to SketchUp Extension Warehouse (EW) is an **independent, optional** flow on top of steps 0–6. It only makes sense for major / first releases — EW review takes 2–3 business days per submission, so don't churn it for every patch bump.

The artifact you submit to EW is the **warehouse variant** (`eval_ruby` off by default), uploaded **unsigned** — Trimble/EW signs it themselves after the review. See [Warehouse vs GitHub release](#warehouse-vs-github-release) below for the full two-artifact picture; this section covers the EW-specific submission details. Both `.rbz` variants are gitignored (`*.rbz` in `.gitignore`).

### Build the warehouse `.rbz`

```bash
(cd mcp_for_sketchup && ruby package.rb --variant=warehouse)
# → mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-warehouse.rbz
```

**Do NOT sign the warehouse `.rbz`.** Upload it **unsigned** through the EW
intake form; the form's "Encryption Type: Encrypt" setting requests Trimble's
signing, which happens **after** the 2–3 day review. The two variants take
different signing paths: only the **github** variant is self-signed by us via
the Trimble extension-signing service
(<https://extensions.sketchup.com/developer/sign-extension>) before it goes to
GitHub Releases (see [Warehouse vs GitHub release](#warehouse-vs-github-release)).

Verify the `.rbz` is well-formed before uploading:

```bash
python3 -c "
import zipfile
z = zipfile.ZipFile('mcp_for_sketchup/mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-warehouse.rbz')
names = sorted(z.namelist())
print('total=', len(names))
print('  .rb=',  sum(1 for n in names if n.endswith('.rb')))
print('root files:', [n for n in names if '/' not in n])
"
```

Expected (`total=` 28, `.rb=` 27):
- 27 `.rb` files: 1 root `mcp_for_sketchup.rb` + 26 inside `mcp_for_sketchup/`. The 26 are the 25 checked-in source files plus the per-build autogenerated `mcp_for_sketchup/core/build_profile.rb` (gitignored; written by `package.rb` at build time and staged into the `.rbz`).
- 1 `.html` (`mcp_for_sketchup/ui/settings.html`), for 28 files total.
- Root files: only `['mcp_for_sketchup.rb']`. No `extension.json` at root — the Trimble/EW signing backend rejects "extra files at root" (see commit 839466c). `extension.json` is also **not** required by EW because the loader (`mcp_for_sketchup.rb`) declares all metadata via `Sketchup::Extension.new(...)`.

### EW form values (stable — copy across releases)

Only Version Number, Release Notes, and the Description occasionally change. Everything else is one-time setup.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Account / Organization | your personal developer account |
| Listing Page checkbox | ☐ off (we ship a real Extension, not a marketing page) |
| Extension Title | **MCP Server for SketchUp** |
| Extension Summary (≤120 chars) | **Connect Claude (or any MCP-aware AI client) to SketchUp for prompt-driven 3D modeling.** |
| Categories (≤3) | Developer Tools, Productivity, Woodworking |
| Version Number | matches the `.rbz` contents (e.g. `0.2.0`) |
| Encryption Type | **Encrypt** |
| Mark as NVIDIA CUDA-Enabled | ☐ off |
| SketchUp Compatibility | 2024, 2025, 2026 (only versions where the plugin has been exercised; 2026 required for `get_viewport_screenshot`) |
| OS Compatibility | Windows, Mac OS X (Ruby code uses stdlib only — no platform-specific API) |
| Supported Languages | English |
| Website | https://github.com/zinin/sketchup-mcp2 |
| Promo Video | (blank — optional) |
| Keywords | `mcp`, `claude`, `ai`, `model-context-protocol`, `automation`, `developer-tools`, `llm` (5–7 strong tags) |
| Description radio | **Markdown** |
| Upload file | the **unsigned** `mcp_for_sketchup_v<X.Y.Z>-warehouse.rbz` — do NOT self-sign; EW signs it after review (filename irrelevant — EW renames on its side) |

Naming conventions / why:
- EW dislikes "SketchUp" as the first word of the title. `<X> for SketchUp` is the convention used by most listings.
- Categories: Developer Tools (it's a dev tool), Productivity (workflow automation), Woodworking (the joinery handlers — `create_mortise_tenon`, `create_dovetail`, `create_finger_joint` — make this surprisingly niche-relevant).
- Compatibility: list what's been actually tested. Don't claim SU 2023 or below — `Sketchup::Camera#is_2d?` requires 2018+ and `RenderingOptions["RenderMode"]` behavior is not verified on older builds.

# MCP Server for SketchUp

Bridge SketchUp with Claude and other MCP-aware AI clients. Drive 3D modeling, edits, materials, and exports from natural-language prompts via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## What it does

This extension runs a local TCP server inside SketchUp that exposes the live model to any AI assistant that speaks MCP. A companion Python package (`sketchup-mcp2` on PyPI) acts as the MCP server your AI client connects to.

**Architecture:** `Claude → Python MCP → TCP socket :9876 → Ruby extension → SketchUp model`

## Features

- **30+ typed tools** for modeling: create components, transforms, booleans (union / difference / intersection), fillet / chamfer, joinery (mortise-tenon, dovetail, finger-joint), materials, layers, selection, exports (skp / obj / dae / stl / png / jpg).
- **Multi-client TCP server** — N concurrent MCP clients can connect simultaneously; per-client error isolation.
- **`get_viewport_screenshot`** tool — captures the SketchUp viewport as a PNG (returns an MCP Image; requires SketchUp 2026+).
- **`sketchup_modeling_strategy`** MCP prompt — teaches your AI assistant project conventions; surfaced in MCP-aware clients' slash menu.
- **One-time `hello` handshake** with version compatibility check between Python client and Ruby server.
- **`eval_ruby` escape hatch** — execute arbitrary Ruby for power-user workflows. **Off by default** in the Extension Warehouse build: enabling it requires confirming a security warning (arbitrary code ⇒ full filesystem/network/shell access), and your MCP client shows each call for approval before it runs.
- **Settings dialog** — Host / Port / Log Level configurable via `Plugins → MCP Server → Settings...` (persisted in SketchUp preferences).
- **Modular Ruby architecture** — clean `core / handlers / helpers / ui` separation.
- **Trimble-signed** — appears as "Signed" in Extension Manager.

## Who it's for

- Architects, designers, and woodworkers using SketchUp who want to drive modeling tasks via natural language.
- Developers building agentic AI workflows that touch 3D / CAD.
- Anyone exploring AI-assisted design.

## Quickstart

1. **Install this extension**: download the `.rbz`, install via `Window → Extension Manager → Install Extension`, restart SketchUp.
2. **Start the server** inside SketchUp: `Plugins → MCP Server → Start`.
3. **Run the Python MCP server**: `uvx sketchup-mcp2` (or `pip install sketchup-mcp2` + `python -m sketchup_mcp`).
4. **Configure your MCP client** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.) to talk to `sketchup-mcp2`.

Full Quickstart with example client configs: https://github.com/zinin/sketchup-mcp2#quickstart

## Compatibility

- **SketchUp**: 2024+ (full features including `get_viewport_screenshot` require 2026+).
- **OS**: Windows, macOS.
- **Python**: 3.10+ (for the companion MCP server).
- **AI clients**: any MCP-aware client — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, custom MCP clients.

## Security note

By default the TCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only). If you bind it to `0.0.0.0` for cross-machine use, the MCP server — including `eval_ruby` (arbitrary Ruby execution) — is exposed to the entire local network with **no authentication**. Use only on trusted networks.
```

### Testing Instructions template (≤1000 chars, paste verbatim)

Critical: moderators don't run a Python MCP client. Keep this 100% verifiable inside SketchUp — anything that requires extra installs risks rejection because the moderator couldn't reproduce.

```text
Quick in-SketchUp test (no external client or Python needed):

1. Install the .rbz: Window → Extension Manager → Install Extension; restart SketchUp.
2. Menu: "Plugins → MCP Server" shows Start, Stop, Settings...
3. Settings: click Settings... — a dialog opens (Host=127.0.0.1, Port=9876, Log Level=WARN). Change Port to 9877 and Log Level to INFO, Save — closes without errors. Reopen: values persist.
4. Start: "Plugins → MCP Server → Start". Ruby Console (Window → Ruby Console) shows a line ending "[MCPforSU] [INFO] tool=application status=started host=127.0.0.1 port=9877". Repeated Start is idempotent.
5. Stop: "Plugins → MCP Server → Stop". Stops cleanly.

Local TCP server (loopback only — no firewall prompt) awaiting MCP-aware AI clients (e.g. Claude). Steps 1-5 cover the in-SketchUp surface; no external service or login required.

### Screenshots

EW requires ≥1 screenshot. Recommended 940×470 px, `.jpg`/`.png`, max 3 MB, up to 5 images.

For this backend-only extension (no own viewport), useful captures — all takeable inside SketchUp in <1 min each, no video recording needed:

1. **Settings dialog** — `Plugins → MCP Server → Settings...` shows the only HTML UI surface (3 fields). Take with Snipping Tool / Cmd+Shift+4.
2. **`Plugins → MCP Server` menu expanded** — shows Start / Stop / Settings menu items. Proves SketchUp integration.
3. **Ruby Console after Start** — set Log Level to `INFO` in Settings first (the default is `WARN`, which suppresses the start line), then `Window → Ruby Console` and `Plugins → MCP Server → Start`. Capture the `[<UTC iso8601>] [MCPforSU] [INFO] tool=application status=started host=127.0.0.1 port=9876` line.

Optional 4th (marketing hero shot): Claude Code or Claude Desktop + SketchUp viewport in split-screen with a Claude-driven build visible. ~10–15 min to set up if Claude isn't already configured against the running server.

### Submit and what happens next

Click **Submit for Review**. EW reviews in 2–3 business days.

- EW renames your uploaded file on its side (typically to `<extension_id>_<version>.rbz`) — the upload filename doesn't surface to end users.
- The catalog serves the warehouse variant (`eval_ruby` off by default); the GitHub Releases page additionally offers the github variant (`eval_ruby` on) for power users. Both end up signed, but via different paths: the github build is self-signed by us via the Trimble signing service before GitHub upload, while the warehouse build is signed by Trimble after the EW review.

## Notes

- `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` ship inside the wheel via `license-files` in `pyproject.toml` — no manual copying needed.
- After the first publish, swap the account-wide PyPI tokens in `~/.pypirc` for **project-scoped** ones (PyPI → Settings → API tokens → Scope: `Project: sketchup-mcp2`). Compromise of a scoped token only affects that project.

## Warehouse vs GitHub release

Two artifacts ship from the same source commit:

- `mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-warehouse.rbz` — submitted to Trimble Extension
  Warehouse via their intake form. `product_id` is `MCP_FOR_SKETCHUP`
  (different from the dead v0.1.0 listing that ran under the prior
  `su_`-prefixed product id). Eval disabled by default.
- `mcp_for_sketchup_vX.Y.Z-github.rbz` — uploaded to the GitHub
  Releases page along with the Python wheel/sdist. Eval enabled by
  default. README links to it as the dev/power-user variant.

Both end up signed, but via different paths: the github build is self-signed by
us via the Trimble signing service before GitHub upload, while the warehouse
build is signed by Trimble after the EW review.

### Submitting via Extension Warehouse (v0.2.0+)

1. Build the warehouse variant: `(cd mcp_for_sketchup && ruby package.rb --variant=warehouse)`
2. Upload it **UNSIGNED** through the Extension Warehouse intake form — do NOT
   pre-sign. Set "Encryption Type: Encrypt" (see [§7](#7-extension-warehouse-submission-optional-23-day-review)
   for the form values) so Trimble signs it; the signing happens after the 2–3
   day review.
3. `product_id` is `MCP_FOR_SKETCHUP` — this is a NEW product, not an
   update to the dead v0.1.0 listing under the prior `su_`-prefixed
   product id.

For the GitHub-Release variant, build with `--variant=github`, self-sign it
yourself via the Trimble extension-signing service
(<https://extensions.sketchup.com/developer/sign-extension>), and upload the
**signed** `.rbz` to GitHub Releases alongside the Python wheel/sdist.

Release notes template (GitHub Releases):

> ## v0.2.0 — Warehouse-compliant rebrand
>
> Two `.rbz` artifacts: warehouse (eval gated, for Trimble Extension Warehouse)
> and github (eval enabled, for power users). The github build is Trimble-signed.
>
> **Wire-protocol break** — old v0.1.0 .rbz cannot handshake with the new
> Python client and vice versa. Upgrade both halves.
